## üöÄ How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues
- Use the [GitHub Issues](../../issues) tab to report bugs, request features, or suggest improvements.
- Be clear and provide as much detail as possible (screenshots, logs, examples).

### 2. Adding a New Government Source
One of our biggest needs is expanding coverage across more countries and regions.

1. Identify an **official government source** (website, RSS, press release page, etc.).  
2. Create a scraper script (preferably with **Scrapy** or **Playwright**) following the `scrapers/` directory structure.  
3. Normalize the data into our common format:
   ```json
   {
      "id": "uuid", 
      "id_type": "uuid-v4", 
      "country": {
         "name": "Kenya",
         "code": "KE"
      },
      "source": {
         "name": "Ministry of Finance",
         "url": "https://mof.gov.ke"
      },
      "language": {
         "original": "sw",
         "translated": "en"
      },
      "title": "New tax policy announced",
      "url": "https://gov.ke/tax-news",
      "content": "...full article in original language...",
      "summary": "Government announced new tax rules effective next month.",
      "tags": ["economy", "finance", "policy"],
      "category": "Economy",
      "priority": "normal",
      "dates": {
         "published_local": "2025-09-01T10:30:00+03:00",
         "published_utc": "2025-09-01T07:30:00Z",
         "scraped_at": "2025-09-01T10:35:12Z",
         "updated_at": "2025-09-01T10:35:12Z"
      },
      "metadata": {
         "source_type": "website", 
         "scraper_version": "1.0.0",
         "content_type": "article"
      },
      "ai_processing": {
         "summarized": true,
         "translated": true,
         "sentiment": "neutral",
         "keywords": ["tax", "policy", "Kenya"]
      },
      "status": "active"

   }
